Pulp Documentation
==================

This documentation is for `pulpcore`, which is used with plugins to fetch, upload, and organize
arbitrary content types.

Anyone interested in writing a plugin should reference the `Pulp Plugin API
<../../pulpcore-plugin/nightly/>`_ documentation.


How to Navigate the pulpcore and plugin docs
--------------------------------------------

Plugin Documentation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you are a new user who is evaluating Pulp it is recommended that you skim the documentation for
the plugins that add the content types you are interested in. Links to these docs can be found in
our `list of plugins <https://pulpproject.org/pulp-3-plugins/>`_

Because the ecosystems of various content types (ie, rpm, docker) can be so diverse, `pulpcore`
stays out of the way for plugins that need to do something differently.

Each plugin can have different features, but as much as possible they follow common patterns to stay
consistent. The potential difference in workflows means that **each plugin is responsible for
documenting all workflows**. Some common plugin workflows the are:

* synchronize from an external repository
* add/remove content manually
* publish and host a repository version, enabling a client to download content
* deferred download (aka, lazy sync)
* lifecycle management

Pulpcore Documentation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

`pulpcore` handles some parts of common content management workflows, including high performance
downloading, task queuing with scalable workers, and management of content within versioned
repositories. Information about :ref:`installation`, :ref:`deployment`, and :doc:`general concepts
and terminology<concepts>` are all covered by the ``pulpcore`` documentation.

 .. note::

    Some parts of the plugin workflows, like manual add/remove and lifecycle management are also
    documented in the pulpcore docs. These cover the common case, but not every plugin will use
    them.  This is why the plugin docs are the single source of truth for the workflows of each
    content type, and pulpcore docs are supplemental.

.. _versioning:

Versioning
----------

Pulp uses a version scheme ``x.y.z``, which is based on `Semantic Versioning
<http://semver.org/>`_. Briefly, ``x.y.z`` releases may only contain bugfixes (no features),
``x.y`` releases may only contain backwards compatible changes (new features, bugfixes), and ``x``
releases may break backwards compatibility.
